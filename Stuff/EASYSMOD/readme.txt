The Enterprise Architect MDG technology for SYSMOD has been developed by
Roman Bretz
Horst Kargl (sparxsystems.eu) 
Bob Hruska (sparxservices.eu)
Franz MÃ¼ller (sparxsystems.eu)
Philipp Kalenda (lieberlieber.com)

The version 2.3 of the SYSMOD MDG technology requires at least Enterprise Architect 14, although version 15.1 is highly recommended.

The MDG technology can be either referenced from the model or imported into the model
For referencing the MDG technology: https://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/15.0/modeling/access_remote_mdg_technologies.html
For importing the MDG technology: https://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/15.0/modeling/importmdgtechnologies.html

Once the MDG technology and associated toolboxes have been activated in Enterprise Architect, they can be used for SysML modeling.
